# Angular2 Starting Guide
Starting an Angular 2 project and don't know where to begin? I got you...

##There are 4 files:
* package.json
* typings.json
* tsconfig.json
* systemjs.config.js

Create a folder, and place all 4 of these files in that folder.


####STOP!!! Do you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer?
>>[Install Them](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm)
  

##Now that you have all these files in your folder, open your CLI.

####Tip: (I suggest using [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) if you are on Mac, it is prettier and has better features than terminal)

Within your CLI, go to the directory that you placed the files in.
Enter this in:
```
npm install
```

Node Package Manager (npm) will install all of the dependencies that are in your package.json file.

####WARNING! If a folder labeled 'typings' doesn't show up, type this in:
```
npm run typings install
```

##Next Steps:
* Create a folder called app
* Begin coding your angular app
